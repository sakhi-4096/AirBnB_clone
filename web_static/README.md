## Description
* This phase of the Airbnb clone project focuses on refining the user interface using HTML and CSS. The **images** folder contains a collection of thoughtfully designed icons that enhance the visual appeal of the site, while the **styles** folder is dedicated to housing the comprehensive set of styles that significantly contribute to the site's polished and professional appearance. The evolution of the project sees the **styles** folder expanding with a larger number of files, reflecting the increased maturity and sophistication of the final iteration of the site.
* **Please note** that the Airbnb Clone Project is an educational exercise and not a fully featured replacement for the actual Airbnb platform. It showcases the use of programming concepts to simulate the functionality of the popular online service in a text-based environment.
